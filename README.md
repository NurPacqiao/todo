TaskMaster - Smart To-Do List
A lightweight, responsive task management application built with Vanilla JavaScript and Bootstrap 5. Designed with a focus on Clean Code architecture, applying SOLID principles and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for maintainability and scalability.

🚀 Features
Create & Delete Tasks: effortlessly add new tasks and remove completed ones.

Data Persistence: Uses localStorage so your data survives page refreshes.

OOP Architecture: structured using classes (Task, StorageManager, UIManager) to separate concerns.

Responsive Design: styled with Bootstrap 5 for a modern, mobile-friendly interface.

Input Validation: prevents empty tasks from being added.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 - Semantic markup.

CSS3 & Bootstrap 5 - Responsive styling and layout.

JavaScript (ES6+) - Logic, DOM manipulation, and LocalStorage integration.

📐 Architecture & Principles
This project moves beyond simple scripting by implementing SOLID principles:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

Task class: Handles data structure.

StorageManager class: Handles localStorage operations.

UIManager class: Handles DOM rendering and updates.

Separation of Concerns: The logic (JS) is decoupled from the styling (CSS/Bootstrap) and the structure (HTML).
